### Project Overview
This project implements a **Digital University System** integrated with a **role-based access control layer** to support secure authentication and authorization for different university users. The objective is to combine the provided Digital University model with an Access Control Layer to ensure that **users can only access features appropriate to their assigned roles**.

The system is built using Java and follows a reference architecture that supports multiple user roles, each with distinct responsibilities. Our implementation focuses on completing and validating four different use cases (Admin, Student, Faculty, and Librarian) while enforcing proper access control throughout the system.

**Key Features:**
- Role-based authentication and authorization (Admin, Faculty, Student, and Librarian role)
- Secure login and logout functionality
- Ability to manage own profile
- Administrator tools for managing users, students, and faculty records
- Faculty functionality for course management, student performance tracking, and profile management
- Student features for course registration, assignment management, transcript review, and graduation auditing
- Librarian features to manage library books (add, update, delete, view books), issue books, accept returned books and update the status, and manage the profile
- Modular Java design following best practices for readability, maintainability, and access control enforcement
